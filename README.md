# Project Skeleton

## What we provide

- Google Auth (Skeleton.js & auth.js)
  - Disclaimer: Auth isn't being taught until the second week.
- Socket Infrastructure (client-socket.js & server-socket.js)
  - Disclaimer: Socket isn't being taught until the second week.
- User Model (auth.js & user.js)

## What you need to change

- Change the font in utilities.css
- Change the Frontend CLIENT_ID for Google Auth (Skeleton.js) (we'll talk about it at the end of week 2)
- Change the Server CLIENT_ID for Google Auth (auth.js) (we'll talk about it at the end of week 2)
- Change the Database SRV for Atlas (server.js)
- Change the Database Name for MongoDB (server.js)
- Add a favicon to your website at the path client/dist/favicon.ico
- Update website title in client/dist/index.html
- Update this README file ;)
- Update the package.json file with your app name :) (line 2)

## Socket stuff
Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you're not using realtime updating or don't need server->client communication, you can remove socket entirely! (server-socket.js, client-socket.js, and anything that imports them)
- If you are using socket, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js
